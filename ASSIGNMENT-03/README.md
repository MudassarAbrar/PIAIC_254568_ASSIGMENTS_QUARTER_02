# ü§ñ StudyBuddy - AI Tutor Chat Agent

**StudyBuddy** is a console-based AI tutor chatbot built using the [Google Generative Language SDK](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-docs). It leverages the Gemini API to provide an interactive and supportive study assistant that helps students understand tough concepts, stay focused, and feel motivated.

## üöÄ Features

- üß† Intelligent chatbot using `gemini-2.0-flash` model
- üí¨ Interactive console chat with real-time responses
- üìö Friendly and encouraging tutor persona
- üìù Automatically logs all conversations to `study_buddy_conversation.md`
- üîê Secure API key management via `.env` file
- ‚ö° Asynchronous client support with `AsyncOpenAI`

---

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- [agents SDK](https://github.com/google/agents-sdk)
- Google Gemini API (via OpenAI-like interface)
- `dotenv` for managing API keys securely

---

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/studybuddy.git
cd studybuddy


## üß† How It Works

1. **Loads your Gemini API key** from the `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.
2. **Initializes an `AsyncOpenAI` client** with the Gemini base URL to communicate with the Gemini model.
3. **Creates a chatbot agent** named **StudyBuddy** with friendly and helpful tutor-like instructions.
4. **Starts a terminal-based input loop**, allowing the user to interact with StudyBuddy in real time.
5. **Logs each conversation** (both user input and StudyBuddy's response) to a markdown file named `study_buddy_conversation.md` for easy review and tracking.




## üí¨ Example Interaction

    a)  `try: ... finally: ...`
    b)  `with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: ...`
    c)  `if ... else: ...`
    d)  `for i in range(10): ...`

3.  **What is the purpose of the `__slots__` attribute in a Python class?**

    a)  To define the order of attributes
    b)  To prevent the creation of new attributes after instantiation, saving memory

4.  **Which module is commonly used for asynchronous programming in Python?**

    a)  `threading`
    b)  `multiprocessing`
    c)  `asyncio`
    d)  `socket`

5.  **What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?**

    a)  A lock that prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode concurrently in a single process
    b)  A lock that prevents access to global variables
    c)  A lock that ensures only one process can run at a time
    d)  A lock that protects memory from being overwritten

6.  **Which of the following is NOT a valid use of metaclasses?**

    a)  Automating attribute creation
    b)  Enforcing coding standards
    c)  Creating singleton classes
    d)  Defining functions

7.  **What is the purpose of the `functools` module?**

    a)  To provide mathematical functions
    b)  To provide higher-order functions and operations on callable objects
    c)  To provide file I/O operations
    d)  To provide network programming tools

8.  **Which of the following is an example of a generator expression?**

    a)  `[x for x in range(10)]`
    b)  `(x for x in range(10))`
    c)  `{x for x in range(10)}`
    d)  `x for x in range(10)`

9.  **What is the purpose of the `collections` module in Python?**

    a)  To provide mathematical data structures
    b)  To provide alternative container datatypes
    c)  To provide regular expression operations
    d)  To provide operating system interfaces

10. **What is the difference between `multiprocessing` and `threading` in Python?**

    a)  `multiprocessing` uses threads, while `threading` uses processes
    b)  `multiprocessing` bypasses the GIL, allowing for true parallelism, while `threading` is limited by the GIL
    c)  `threading` is faster than `multiprocessing`
    d)  There is no difference
